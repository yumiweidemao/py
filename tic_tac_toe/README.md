This is a classic Tic-tac-toe game written in Python, using the Pygame library. One should install Pygame before running the game.
One way to install is to run in terminal: `pip install pygame`.

Make sure that the file classes.py and the main file are in the same directory. Run in terminal `python tic_tac_toe.py` to start the game.

Enjoy!
